<h2>who i am in a nutshell</h2>
My name is Karynn and I am a tiny, twenty something New Yorker, an Aquarius, born in the Year of the Rat, and an ENFJ.

<p>I sometimes view life through thick-framed glasses or a Nikon lens, and for the most part, through optimism. I'm a versatile foodie who's feasted on Michelin star meals to bugs off a rainforest tree - and who also loves good cup of coffee, a glass of Beaujolais or a dark stout, depending on my mood and/or company. I travel to discover, not to relax. My funny hubby and zany family are the center of my world.

<p>I am a learning addict. I took classes in basic Mandarin, taught myself the guitar and ukulele, tried my hand at Samurai swordfighting, took a basic shooting class, joined an acrylics course, and signed up for a half marathon so I could learn how to run better. Now I want to learn how to code!</p>

<h2>a timeline</h2>
  <h3>1985</h3> Born in a tiny town in Texas. Population: ~1000.
  <h3>1988</h3> My parents decided to move our family to New York. Population: ~7 million.
  <h3>1992</h3> I starred in my first school play. I was Reader #3.
  <h3>1998</h3> My softball team won the "World Series" and I played in that year's All-Star league. I was the second base(wo)man.
  <h3>2003</h3> I graduated from high school as a National Honor Society student, a Features editor for the school paper, and a one-time, never again tap dancer in our annual Christmas spectacular. 
  <h3>2007</h3> After an awesome three and a half years, I graduated from Boston University with a Bachelor of Science in Communications and minor in Business Administration. Go Terriers!
<p>That summer after graduation, I joined a young company called Communispace Corporation in Boston, MA, working on uncovering game-changing consumer insights for some of the biggest companies in the world, creating company culture and corporate social responsibility, and meeting some of my best friends.
  <h3>2010</h3> Missing home, I moved back and joined a publishing start-up called Mediaplanet. I pitched and closed sales for the first time and ultimately published two special edition reports in USA Today and The Washington Post.  
  <h3>2011</h3> Communispace opened up an office in Manhattan and I was asked to return, to help pioneer the new office with 7 other awesome people. Today, it's an office of 20, working with some of the hugest companies in NYC.
  <h3>2014</h3> I got married to an awesome dude, who's a foot taller than me, loves math, and is my faithful companion on every adventure. 
  <p>With the future in mind, I started thinking about where I wanted to be in 10 years. I job searched. I researched. I soul-searched.
  <h3>Present</h3> I am currently discovering the magic and fun of coding. To be technical, I am creating a website for the General Assembly application process! And crossing my fingers.
