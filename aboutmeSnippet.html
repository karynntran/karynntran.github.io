<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
My name is Karynn and I am a tiny, twenty something New Yorker, an Aquarius, born in the Year of the Rat, and an ENFJ.

<p>I sometimes view life through thick-framed glasses or a Nikon lens, and for the most part, through optimism. I'm a versatile foodie who's feasted on Michelin star meals to bugs off a rainforest tree - and who also loves good cup of coffee, a glass of Beaujolais or a dark stout, depending on my mood and/or company. I travel to discover, not to relax. My funny hubby and zany family are the center of my world.

<p>I am a learning addict. I took classes in basic Mandarin, taught myself the guitar and ukulele, tried my hand at Samurai swordfighting, took a basic shooting class, completed an acrylics course, and signed up for a half marathon so I could learn how to run better. Now, I'm learning to code!</p>
